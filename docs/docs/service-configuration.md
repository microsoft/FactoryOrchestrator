# Factory Orchestrator service configuration using appsettings.json
The Factory Orchestrator service has many configurable settings that impact its startup behavior, enabled features, and more. This configuration is easily modified using an [appsettings.json file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration-providers#json-configuration-provider).

The appsettings.json file is checked for in two locations:

- The directory where the service executable (Microsoft.FactoryOrchestrator.Service) is located
- The [service log file directory](#factory-orchestrator-service-log-file) (`%ProgramData%\FactoryOrchestrator\` or `/var/log/FactoryOrchestrator/`)

The following table describes each setting and its usage:

| Setting             | Type | UsageÂ                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| InitialTaskListsÂ  | string | Path to a [FactoryOrchestratorXML](tasks-and-tasklists.md#author-and-manage-factory-orchestrator-tasklists) file. The [TaskLists](tasks-and-tasklists.md#author-and-manage-factory-orchestrator-tasklists) in this file are loaded on first boot only; they are NOT run by default unless RunInitialTaskListsOnFirstBoot is set. This file defines the default "first boot" state of the DUT, that is the TaskLists & tasks that are shown in the app UI. |
| RunInitialTaskListsOnFirstBoot | bool | If set to "true", the TaskLists defined by InitialTaskListsÂ are run on first boot of the DUT (or the first time the service is run). They are not run on subsquent boots. |
| FirstBootTasksÂ    | string | Path to a [FactoryOrchestratorXML](tasks-and-tasklists.md#author-and-manage-factory-orchestrator-tasklists) file. These TaskLists are run once, on the first boot of the DUT (or the first time the service is run). They are not run on subsquent boots. |
| EveryBootTasksÂ    | string | Path to a [FactoryOrchestratorXML](tasks-and-tasklists.md#author-and-manage-factory-orchestrator-tasklists) file. These TaskLists are run on every boot of the DUT, including first boot. |


## Network access
By default, the Factory Orchestrator service only allows client connections from the same device the service is running on (i.e. localhost only). However, service can be configured to allow connections from clients anywhere on your local network.

<p align="center"><i>WARNING: Please read and understand the following before enabling network access!</i></p>

</b>

- âš  The service allows any client to connect to it without authentication. Any connected client has full access to the service's computer, including the ability to send or copy files, and/or run any command or program with administrator rights. âš  (The service has SSL encryption, but it is server-only, clients are not authenticated.)
- âš  If you "install" the service, the service may be configured to run from boot. Depending on the configuration the service may even be running before a user has logged on to the computer. âš 
- âš  Once network access is enabled, it will remain enabled until the changes to enable network access are [reverted](#disable-network-access). âš 
- âš  The service and client send information over the network in SSL encrypted JSON using TCP. It is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, as the service defaults to a predefined SSL certificate unless a custom certificate is used. âš 
- âš  The service currently has minimal logging about what clients are connected to it and what commands each client has executed. âš 

If you understand these risks but still wish for the service to communicate with clients over the local network, set both of the following settings:
EnableNetworkAccess = 1
DisableNetworkAcess = 0

To check if network access is currently enabled use one of the following:

- The Factory Orchestrator app's "About" page.
- The console output from Microsoft.FactoryOrchestrator.Service.exe
- The [service log file](#factory-orchestrator-service-log-file)
- The [IsNetworkAccessEnabled](../ClientLibrary/Microsoft-FactoryOrchestrator-Client-FactoryOrchestratorClient-IsNetworkAccessEnabled%28%29/) API.

## Configure Factory Orchestrator to automatically load and execute TaskLists when it starts

The Factory Orchestrator service looks for certain [FactoryOrchestratorXML](tasks-and-tasklists.md#author-and-manage-factory-orchestrator-tasklists) files when it starts. You can use these FactoryOrchestratorXML files to pre-load tasks into Factory Orchestrator (without running them), run tasks the first time a device boots, or run tasks every time a device boots.

The appsettings.json settings determine this startup behavior:

## InitialTaskLists, FirstBootTasks, and EveryBootTasksÂ 
_ðŸ’¡ [We are considering reworking InitialTaskLists and \*BootTasks, as it is hard to understand the trade-offs involved with each type](https://github.com/microsoft/FactoryOrchestrator/issues/109). ðŸ’¡_

These 3 FactoryOrchestratorXML files are executed in the following order:

1. FirstBootTasks (if it is first boot)
2. EveryBootTasks
3. Then finally InitialTaskLists (if it is first boot & RunInitialTaskListsOnFirstBoot is set).

The FirstBootTasksÂ & EveryBootTasksÂ settings are intended to be used for "configuration" & "pre-setup" operations, as they are tracked separately from all other Tasks, and their state is 'hidden' on completion. For example, starting a non-critical logger service every boot would be a good use of the EveryBootTasks. On the other hand, InitialTaskListsÂ is intended to be used to setup the "first run" state of Factory Orchestrator. Keep in mind this state is only the "first run" state, it may change as client(s) interact with Factory Orchestrator.

FirstBootTasksÂ & EveryBootTasks have the following 'rules':

- While you can author normal `<Tasks>` in the \*BootTasks files, [`<BackgroundTasks>`](tasks-and-tasklists.md#background-tasks) are especially useful, as you can define `<BackgroundTasks>` which start on boot, are never expected to ever exit, and will run in the background forever (provided `TerminateBackgroundTasksOnCompletion="false"`).
- When all `<Tasks>` defined in the \*BootTasks FactoryOrchestratorXML files are done executing, the service "resets" and any TaskLists & Tasks defined in thoes 2 files are "hidden". This means that the app UI will only show the TaskLists defined by the InitialTaskListsÂ setting if this is the first boot, and possibly any TaskListsÂ that have been added at runtime by a client (if this isn't the first boot).
- `<TaskLists>` defined in the \*BootTasks FactoryOrchestratorXML files are only returned by GetTaskListGuids() and GetTaskListSummaries() [client methods](use-the-factory-orchestrator-api.md) **only while the service is actively executing boot TaskLists**. Upon completion of all boot TaskLists, you can only query boot TaskList information via the GetBootTaskListGuids(), & GetBootTaskListSummaries() client methods. You can also query the \*BootTasks Tasks and TaskLists directly **at any time** if you know their GUID using QueryTask(), QueryTaskList(), and QueryTaskRun().
- The Factory Orchestrator service does not allow certain client commands to run until all `<Tasks>` (excluding `<BackgroundTasks>`) defined in the relevant \*BootTasks files are done executing. You will get a FactoryOrchestratorBootTasksExecutingException if you call them while the *BootTasks files are running. You can check the [FactoryOrchestrator service log file](service-configuration.md#factory-orchestrator-logs) to see if the \*BootTasks files are done executing. Or use the IsExecutingBootTasks() [client API](use-the-factory-orchestrator-api.md). Lastly, when the service is running one of the two \*BootTasks files, you'll see a warning in the Factory Orchestrator app UI: ![Service is executing Boot tasks, many functions are disabled until finished or aborted](./images/fo-background-tasks-executing.png)

You can inspect the [FactoryOrchestrator service and Task run log files](service-configuration.md#factory-orchestrator-logs) for details about the status and/or results of the \*BootTasks FactoryOrchestratorXML files, in "EveryBootTaskLists" & "FirstBootTaskLists" subfolders in the task run log directory.

# Factory Orchestrator logs
## Factory Orchestrator service log file
The service log file contains details about the operation of the Factory Orchestrator service. It is always found at `%ProgramData%\FactoryOrchestrator\FactoryOrchestratorService.log` on Windows and `/var/log/FactoryOrchestrator/FactoryOrchestratorService.log` on Linux. Inspect this log for details about the service's operation.

## Factory Orchestrator Task log files
See [Tasks and Tasklists](tasks-and-tasklists.md#factory-orchestrator-task-log-files) for details about the log files for individual Task runs.
